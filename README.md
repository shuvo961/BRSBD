The long-term goal of this project is to create an Automated Birth Registration System. Parents can register with their newbornâ€™s details information and have to collect the birth certificate from the nearest union office. This system will also generate an Online Birth Registration Certificate. Parents can get it or print it from the system. Users must need to submit their NID number to register and they can also check the progress by logging in using the same NID.
